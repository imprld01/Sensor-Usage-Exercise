# Sensor-Usage-Exercise

A program to access many types of sensors that Android supports.  
This program uses *SensorManager* to get some useful sensors,  
telling *SensorManager* to attach corresponding listener to each sensor.

This repository as a **note** help me to find the code in the future! ðŸ˜€
